# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to check the viability of bike sharing business in Des Moines by analysing data from New York City. 
I tried to answer the following questions in the analysis:
- Demographics of the users
- Type of Users
- Peak tripduration
- Tripduration by gender
- Peak rentals hours
- Peak rental Hours by gender
-

 ## Type of User:
 
 Analysis shows that more than ~81% are Subscribers, with an ~19% are non-subscribers/short-term. The short term users include visitors and tourist in NYC. Des Moines is not really a tourist place as compared to NYC so we should come up with a affordable subscription model for long term users.

# Summary:

In conclusion, Des Moines is a good candidate for starting a rental bike business as it is nit a tourist place and data shows that rental bike is used mostly for residents as a subscriber. So I highly recommend a affordable subscription model for long term users. 

Also I would like to create more visualization to understand the market better, for example:
- bike share usage by age groups. 
- bike share location to help me understand the logistics of inventory anf maintaince.
